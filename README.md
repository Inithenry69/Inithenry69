**`Experienced Roblox Luau Scripter of 4 Years`**

I am an indie fullstack roblox developer. Every project I make I put my upmost passion into it and write excellent, clean code. I try to do things in ways that are as efficent as possible and have never been done before. My dream is to become a full time roblox developer and I hope whoever it may be reading this can help me fulfil that goal.

### 🎒 Languages and tools
The languages other than lua are languages I know and used before starting roblox development. These I am not as experienced in but I do know my way around.
